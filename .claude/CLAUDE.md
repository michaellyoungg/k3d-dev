# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This project is developing a unified command-line tool (`plat`) for managing local microservice development environments. The tool integrates k3d (lightweight Kubernetes) and Helm (package management) to provide a seamless developer experience.

**Core Goal**: Simplify and standardize local microservice development workflows by abstracting away infrastructure complexity while maintaining flexibility and power.

## Key Concepts

**Target Technologies**:
- **k3d**: Lightweight Kubernetes clusters for local development
- **Helm**: Application packaging and deployment

**Primary Use Cases**:
- First-time project setup and environment initialization
- Daily development workflows with hot-reload and debugging
- Multi-service integration testing
- Debugging production issues locally
- Team collaboration on shared development environments

## Current Status

**Phase**: Planning and Documentation
- âœ… Project vision and requirements defined
- âœ… Use cases and user personas documented
- âœ… CLI ergonomics and command structure planned
- âœ… System architecture designed
- âœ… Technology integration patterns specified
- ðŸš§ Implementation planning in progress

## Development Approach

When implementing this tool:

1. **Start Small**: Begin with core environment lifecycle (init, up, stop, status)
2. **Prioritize Ergonomics**: Focus on developer experience and simple commands
3. **Embrace Standards**: Follow established CLI conventions and configuration patterns
4. **Design for Extension**: Plugin architecture for custom service types and workflows
5. **Validate Early**: Test with real microservice projects and gather feedback

## Architecture Highlights

- **Layered Configuration**: Global â†’ Project â†’ Environment â†’ Runtime overrides
- **Service Orchestration**: Dependency management with health checks
- **Plugin System**: Extensible service types and custom commands
- **State Management**: Local SQLite for environment state persistence
- **Tool Integration**: Direct API/CLI integration with k3d and Helm
