# Project Overview: Local Development Environment Tool

## Vision

Create a unified command-line tool that simplifies and standardizes local microservice development workflows using modern cloud-native technologies. The tool should abstract away the complexity of managing multiple infrastructure components while providing developers with a seamless, productive development experience.

## Problem Statement

Modern microservice development involves orchestrating multiple complex tools:
- **k3d** for lightweight Kubernetes clusters
- **Helm** for application packaging and deployment
- **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning
- Service mesh configuration, ingress, monitoring, etc.

Current pain points:
- Context switching between different CLI tools and configuration formats
- Manual coordination of service startup/shutdown sequences
- Inconsistent development environments across team members
- Complex debugging when services fail to communicate
- Time-consuming environment recreation and cleanup

## Core Intent

Build a tool that:
1. **Unifies** the developer experience across k3d, Helm, and Terraform
2. **Automates** common development workflows and environment management
3. **Standardizes** project structure and configuration patterns
4. **Accelerates** the inner development loop for microservice teams
5. **Simplifies** debugging and troubleshooting of local environments

## Success Criteria

- Reduce time to spin up a full microservice environment from hours to minutes
- Enable developers to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure configuration
- Provide consistent, reproducible environments across different machines and team members
- Support both individual developer workflows and team collaboration patterns
- Integrate seamlessly with existing CI/CD and deployment pipelines

## Target Users

- **Individual Developers**: Working on microservice applications locally
- **Development Teams**: Collaborating on multi-service architectures
- **DevOps Engineers**: Standardizing development environment tooling
- **Engineering Leaders**: Seeking to improve developer productivity and experience
