## Investigation Process

### 1. Problem Analysis Phase

#### Define the Problem
```markdown
# Investigation: [Problem Title]

## Problem Definition
**What**: [Specific issue or requirement]
**Why**: [Business/technical justification]
**Who**: [Stakeholders affected]
**When**: [Timeline constraints]
**Where**: [System components involved]

## Success Criteria
[Specific, measurable outcomes]

## Out of Scope
[What this investigation will NOT address]
```

#### Consult Existing Documentation
**Required Reading Checklist**:
- [ ] Project overview for context and goals
- [ ] Requirements for functional/non-functional needs
- [ ] Use cases for user impact analysis
- [ ] Ergonomics for UX considerations
- [ ] Architecture for technical constraints
- [ ] Technology integration for tool compatibility
- [ ] Previous decision records for related choices

### 2. Research Phase

#### Industry Standards Research
```markdown
## Industry Analysis

### Standard Practices
- [Practice 1]: [Description and adoption]
- [Practice 2]: [Description and adoption]

### Established Tools
| Tool | Pros | Cons | Adoption | Our Fit |
|------|------|------|----------|---------|
| [Tool 1] | [Benefits] | [Drawbacks] | [Widespread/Niche] | [H/M/L] |
| [Tool 2] | [Benefits] | [Drawbacks] | [Widespread/Niche] | [H/M/L] |

### Reference Implementations
- [Project/Company 1]: [Their approach and results]
- [Project/Company 2]: [Their approach and results]
```

#### Validation Research
```markdown
## Validation Sources

### Primary Sources
- [ ] Official documentation
- [ ] Tool maintainer recommendations  
- [ ] Peer-reviewed articles

### Secondary Sources
- [ ] Community discussions
- [ ] Blog posts and tutorials
- [ ] Stack Overflow insights

### Validation Experiments
- [ ] Proof of concept implementation
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Integration testing
```

### 3. Solution Generation

#### Option Generation Framework
For each potential solution, evaluate:

1. **Alignment with Established Practices**
   - Is this a standard approach in the industry?
   - Do existing tools support this pattern?
   - Is there community momentum behind this approach?

2. **Simplicity Assessment** 
   - Minimal viable implementation complexity?
   - Future maintenance burden?
   - Learning curve for team members?

3. **Architectural Coherence**
   - Fits with existing system design?
   - Consistent with established patterns?
   - Enables future extensibility?

4. **Implementation Feasibility**
   - Available time and resources?
   - Required expertise and tools?
   - Dependencies and risks?

## Validation Checklists

### Pre-Implementation Validation
- [ ] **Requirements alignment**: Solution addresses stated requirements
- [ ] **Use case coverage**: Key user scenarios are supported
- [ ] **Ergonomic consistency**: Fits established UX patterns
- [ ] **Architectural coherence**: Aligns with system design
- [ ] **Tool integration**: Works with k3d, Helm, Terraform as planned
- [ ] **Established practice**: Uses industry-standard approaches
- [ ] **Simplicity principle**: Minimal viable solution
- [ ] **Extension readiness**: Plugin points identified

### Post-Implementation Validation
- [ ] **Functional correctness**: All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] **Performance acceptable**: Within established benchmarks
- [ ] **Error handling robust**: Graceful failure modes
- [ ] **Documentation updated**: Changes reflected in docs
- [ ] **Integration verified**: Works with related components
- [ ] **User experience validated**: Meets ergonomic standards

## Escalation Triggers

Escalate for additional review when:

1. **High Impact Decisions**
   - Core architecture changes
   - Major dependency additions
   - Breaking changes to interfaces

2. **Uncertain Trade-offs**
   - Multiple viable options with unclear best choice
   - Significant complexity vs. simplicity tensions
   - Performance vs. maintainability conflicts

3. **Deviation from Standards**
   - Proposing non-standard approaches
   - Creating bespoke solutions over established tools
   - Architectural pattern changes

## Decision Review Process

### Weekly Decision Audit
Review recent decisions for:
- [ ] **Outcome alignment**: Are results matching expectations?
- [ ] **Implementation reality**: Are estimates proving accurate?
- [ ] **Assumption validation**: Are our assumptions holding true?
- [ ] **Course correction needs**: Should we adjust approach?

### Monthly Architecture Review
- [ ] **Coherence check**: Is overall system design still coherent?
- [ ] **Complexity assessment**: Are we maintaining simplicity?
- [ ] **Tool integration health**: Are our integrations working well?
- [ ] **Future readiness**: Are we positioned for upcoming needs?
