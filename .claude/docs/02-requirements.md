- **FR-017**: Health checks and status monitoring dashboard
- **FR-018**: Interactive debugging capabilities (attach to running containers)
- **FR-019**: Configuration templating and environment variable management
- **FR-020**: Integration with local IDE/editor workflows

### Configuration Management

#### Project Structure
- **FR-021**: Define standard project layout for microservice applications
- **FR-022**: Support for monorepo and multi-repo development patterns
- **FR-023**: Hierarchical configuration inheritance (global -> project -> service)
- **FR-024**: Environment-specific overrides and customizations

#### Version Control Integration
- **FR-025**: Track environment configurations in version control
- **FR-026**: Share environment definitions across team members
- **FR-027**: Support for configuration drift detection and resolution
- **FR-028**: Integration with GitOps workflows

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **NFR-001**: Environment startup time < 2 minutes for typical microservice stack
- **NFR-002**: Service hot-reload time < 10 seconds
- **NFR-003**: Memory footprint < 500MB for tool itself
- **NFR-004**: Support for 10+ concurrent services in single environment

### Reliability
- **NFR-005**: Graceful handling of service failures and dependencies
- **NFR-006**: Automatic recovery from transient infrastructure issues
- **NFR-007**: Data persistence across environment restarts
- **NFR-008**: Backup and restore capabilities for development data

### Usability
- **NFR-009**: Single command to start complete development environment
- **NFR-010**: Clear, actionable error messages with suggested fixes

- **NFR-012**: Consistent command-line interface following POSIX conventions

### Compatibility
- **NFR-013**: Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- **NFR-014**: Version compatibility matrix for k3d, Helm, Terraform
- **NFR-015**: Integration with popular development tools and IDEs
- **NFR-016**: Container registry flexibility (Docker Hub, private registries)

### Security
- **NFR-017**: Secure credential management (no plain text secrets)
- **NFR-018**: Network isolation between development environments
- **NFR-019**: RBAC integration for team environments
- **NFR-020**: Audit logging for environment operations

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing k3d, Helm, and Terraform installations
- Limited to local development use cases (not production deployment)
- Docker/container runtime dependency
- Kubernetes API compatibility requirements

### Business Constraints
- Open source development model
- Community-driven feature prioritization
- Documentation and examples must be maintained
- Backward compatibility for configuration formats

### Assumptions
- Developers have basic familiarity with containerized applications
- Local machine has sufficient resources for running multiple services
- Network connectivity available for pulling container images and charts
- Development team uses Git for version control
