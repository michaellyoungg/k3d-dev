# Use Cases and User Scenarios

## Primary Use Cases

### UC-001: First-Time Project Setup

**Actor**: New Developer joining a microservice project

**Scenario**: Sarah joins a team working on an e-commerce platform with 8 microservices. She needs to get a complete development environment running on her MacBook.

**Flow**:
1. Clone project repository containing tool configuration
2. Run `devenv init` to validate prerequisites and setup
3. Run `devenv up` to provision k3d cluster and deploy all services
4. Access application through local ingress
5. Make code changes and see hot-reloaded results

**Success Criteria**: Full environment running in under 5 minutes with zero manual configuration.

### UC-002: Daily Development Workflow

**Actor**: Experienced Developer working on feature development

**Scenario**: Mike is developing a new payment service feature and needs to test integration with existing services.

**Flow**:
1. Start focused environment with only required services: `devenv up --services payment,user,order`
2. Attach debugger to payment service: `devenv debug payment`
3. Make code changes and see automatic redeployment
4. View aggregated logs: `devenv logs --follow`
5. Run integration tests against local environment
6. Stop environment preserving data: `devenv stop --persist-data`

**Success Criteria**: Rapid iteration cycles with sub-10-second feedback loops.

### UC-003: Multi-Service Integration Testing

**Actor**: QA Engineer testing cross-service functionality

**Scenario**: Jessica needs to test a checkout flow that spans multiple services with specific data scenarios.

**Flow**:
1. Start environment with test data: `devenv up --profile integration-test`
2. Load test data: `devenv data load --dataset checkout-scenarios`
3. Scale services to simulate load: `devenv scale payment=3 inventory=2`
4. Run automated test suite: `devenv exec test -- npm run integration`
5. Capture environment snapshot: `devenv snapshot save checkout-test-v1`
6. Reset and repeat with different data: `devenv data reset && devenv data load --dataset edge-cases`

**Success Criteria**: Reproducible test environments with consistent data states.

### UC-004: Debugging Production Issues Locally

**Actor**: Senior Developer investigating production bug

**Scenario**: Alex needs to reproduce a race condition that only occurs under specific timing conditions in production.

**Flow**:
1. Create environment matching production topology: `devenv up --profile production-like`
2. Load production-similar dataset: `devenv data restore --from prod-snapshot-sanitized`
3. Enable detailed tracing: `devenv config set tracing.level=debug`
4. Simulate production load patterns: `devenv load-test --pattern production-traffic.yml`
5. Monitor service interactions: `devenv trace --services payment,inventory,order`
6. Reproduce issue and collect debugging data

**Success Criteria**: Ability to recreate production-like conditions locally for effective debugging.

### UC-005: Team Collaboration on Shared Features

**Actor**: Development Team working on cross-cutting feature

**Scenario**: A team of 4 developers is building a new recommendation engine that affects multiple services.

**Flow**:
1. Lead creates feature branch environment config: `devenv config branch feature/recommendations`
2. Team members sync environment: `devenv sync --branch feature/recommendations`
3. Each developer works on different services in parallel
4. Share intermediate changes: `devenv publish --service recommendation-api`
5. Integration testing with latest changes from all team members
6. Resolve conflicts in environment configuration

**Success Criteria**: Seamless collaboration without environment conflicts or manual coordination.

## Secondary Use Cases

### UC-006: Environment Troubleshooting

**Actor**: DevOps Engineer helping developers with environment issues

**Scenario**: Environment fails to start due to resource constraints or configuration errors.

**Flow**:
1. Diagnose environment health: `devenv doctor`
2. Check resource utilization: `devenv status --resources`
3. Validate configurations: `devenv config validate`
4. Review detailed startup logs: `devenv logs --startup --verbose`
5. Apply fixes and restart: `devenv restart --service problematic-service`

---

### UC-007: Performance Optimization

**Actor**: Performance Engineer optimizing service interactions

**Scenario**: Identifying bottlenecks in service communication patterns.

**Flow**:
1. Start environment with monitoring: `devenv up --monitoring`
2. Generate realistic load: `devenv load-test --scenario realistic-usage`
3. Analyze performance metrics: `devenv metrics --export prometheus`
4. Profile individual services: `devenv profile --service slow-service`
5. Compare before/after optimization results

---

### UC-008: Configuration Migration

**Actor**: Platform Team upgrading infrastructure versions

**Scenario**: Migrating from k3d v1.21 to v1.24 and Helm v3.8 to v3.10.

**Flow**:
1. Create migration branch: `devenv config branch migration/k8s-1.24`
2. Update version constraints: `devenv config set kubernetes.version=1.24`
3. Test compatibility: `devenv validate --all-services`
4. Gradual rollout: `devenv migrate --dry-run && devenv migrate --confirm`
5. Update team documentation: `devenv docs generate`
