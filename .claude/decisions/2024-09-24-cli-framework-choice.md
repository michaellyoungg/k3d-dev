# Decision Record: CLI Framework Choice

**Date**: 2024-09-24
**Status**: Proposed
**Context**: Selecting foundational CLI framework for devenv tool

## Problem Statement

We need to choose a CLI framework for building the `devenv` tool that will orchestrate k3d, Helm, and Terraform for local microservice development environments. The framework must support our complex command structure, external tool integration, and performance requirements.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Supports complex nested command structures (devenv service deploy, etc.)
- [ ] Excellent performance for external process execution
- [ ] Memory footprint < 500MB for tool itself (NFR-003)
- [ ] Sub-10 second response times for service operations (NFR-002)
- [ ] Strong ecosystem for CLI features (autocompletion, help, validation)
- [ ] Team familiarity and maintenance considerations

### Constraints
- Must integrate with existing k3d, helm, and terraform CLI tools via process execution
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows) required (NFR-013)
- Development team needs to be productive quickly
- Tool will be called frequently throughout developer workflows

## Research Summary

### Existing Documentation Consulted
- [x] `01-project-overview.md` - Core goal of unified developer experience
- [x] `02-requirements.md` - Performance requirements (NFR-001-004), cross-platform needs
- [x] `03-use-cases.md` - Daily development workflows, external tool orchestration
- [x] `04-ergonomics.md` - Complex command structure design (devenv up, deploy, scale, etc.)
- [x] `05-architecture.md` - CLI Parser requirements, integration layer needs
- [x] `06-technology-integration.md` - Heavy external process integration required

### External Research
- **Industry Standards**: Both Cobra (Go) and Commander.js (Node.js) are established, mature frameworks
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Go consistently outperforms Node.js (245ms vs 653ms in compute tasks)
- **External Process Execution**: Go's os/exec more efficient than Node.js spawn/exec for CLI orchestration
- **Ecosystem**: Both have strong ecosystems, with Cobra used by Kubernetes, Docker, Hugo; Commander by 99,612 npm packages

## Options Analysis

### Option 1: Go with Cobra
**Description**: Build CLI using Go language with Cobra framework

**Pros**:
- **Superior Performance**: Go execution ~2.6x faster than Node.js in benchmarks
- **Memory Efficiency**: Compiled binary with minimal runtime overhead, fits <500MB requirement easily
- **External Process Optimization**: os/exec package highly optimized for CLI tool orchestration
- **Fast Startup**: No interpreter/JIT overhead, critical for frequent CLI usage
- **Industry Proven**: Used by Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, Hugo - exactly our target ecosystem
- **Resource Management**: Better concurrent handling of multiple external processes (k3d, helm, terraform)
- **Cross-Platform**: Single compiled binary deployment
- **Team Alignment**: Kubernetes ecosystem familiarity

**Cons**:
- **Development Speed**: Potentially slower initial development vs interpreted language
- **Learning Curve**: If team lacks Go experience (needs validation)
- **Binary Management**: Need build/distribution pipeline

**Effort**: Medium
**Risk**: Low (proven ecosystem alignment)

### Option 2: Node.js with Commander.js
**Description**: Build CLI using Node.js with Commander.js framework

**Pros**:
- **Rapid Development**: Faster iteration cycles during development
- **Team Familiarity**: Potentially easier if team has stronger JS background
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Extensive npm package ecosystem (chalk, inquirer, etc.)
- **Modern Features**: Latest v14.0.1 with TypeScript support, good developer experience
- **Established**: 99,612 projects using Commander.js

**Cons**:
- **Performance Penalty**: ~2.6x slower execution, significant for CLI orchestration tool
- **Memory Overhead**: V8 runtime overhead may challenge <500MB requirement under load
- **External Process Bottleneck**: Node.js spawn/exec slower for heavy CLI orchestration
- **Startup Time**: JIT compilation overhead impacts frequent CLI usage
- **Single-Threaded Limitations**: Event loop can be blocked by intensive external process operations
- **Runtime Dependency**: Requires Node.js installation on target systems

**Effort**: Medium-Low
**Risk**: Medium (performance constraints)

### Option 3: Alternative Frameworks (Rust Clap, etc.)
**Description**: Consider other modern CLI frameworks

**Pros**:
- **Rust Performance**: Even faster than Go in some benchmarks
- **Memory Safety**: Additional safety guarantees

**Cons**:
- **Team Learning Curve**: Likely steepest learning curve
- **Ecosystem Gap**: Less integration with k3d/helm/terraform ecosystem
- **Development Speed**: Slower initial development

**Effort**: High
**Risk**: High (unknown ecosystem integration)

## Decision

**Chosen**: Option 1 - Go with Cobra

**Rationale**:
Based on comprehensive analysis, Go with Cobra is the clear choice for our CLI tool:

1. **Performance Alignment**: Our tool will heavily orchestrate external processes (k3d, helm, terraform). Go's 2.6x performance advantage and superior external process handling directly addresses our core use case.

2. **Memory Requirements**: NFR-003 requires <500MB memory footprint. Go's compiled binary with minimal runtime overhead easily meets this, while Node.js V8 runtime presents risk under concurrent operations.

3. **Ecosystem Coherence**: Cobra is used by Kubernetes, Docker, Helm - the exact ecosystem we're integrating with. This provides proven patterns and community familiarity.

4. **Daily Usage Optimization**: CLI tools are called frequently (devenv up, logs, status). Go's zero-startup-time advantage compounds across developer workflows.

5. **Concurrent Process Management**: Our tool manages multiple services (NFR-004: 10+ concurrent services). Go's goroutines and resource management are superior to Node.js event loop for this workload.

**Key Factors**:
- External process performance is our primary bottleneck - Go excels here
- Memory efficiency critical for developer machine resource usage
- Kubernetes ecosystem alignment provides established patterns
- Single binary distribution simplifies tool installation and maintenance

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Go learning curve | Medium | Low | Start with simple commands, leverage Cobra docs/examples |
| Binary distribution complexity | Low | Medium | Use GitHub Actions for automated cross-platform builds |
| Performance not meeting expectations | Low | High | Benchmark early against requirements, profile bottlenecks |
| External tool API changes | Medium | Medium | Implement abstraction layer, version compatibility matrix |

## Future Considerations

- **Plugin System**: Go's interface system excellent for future extensibility
- **Performance Monitoring**: Go's built-in profiling tools for optimization
- **Container Integration**: Native Docker image creation for CI/CD scenarios
- **API Expansion**: Potential future HTTP API built on same core engine

## Validation Against Requirements

**Performance Requirements**:
- NFR-001 (< 2min startup): Go's external process efficiency supports this
- NFR-002 (< 10s operations): Go performance advantage critical here
- NFR-003 (< 500MB memory): Go binary easily meets this
- NFR-004 (10+ services): Go concurrency model handles this well

**Usability Requirements**: 
- Cobra provides excellent CLI UX patterns (help, completion, validation)
- Single binary distribution simplifies installation

**Compatibility Requirements**:
- Cross-platform compilation built into Go toolchain
- Integration with existing k3d/helm/terraform follows established patterns
