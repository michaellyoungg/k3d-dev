# Decision Record: Product Strategy and North Star

**Date**: 2024-09-25
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Defining clear product boundaries and user experience goals to avoid feature creep

## Problem Statement

Without clear strategic boundaries, we risk building an over-engineered, highly configurable tool that creates overhead rather than solving the core developer problem. We need a north star to guide all implementation decisions and keep the user experience simple and clean.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Clear product positioning vs. existing tools
- [ ] Defined boundaries of what NOT to build
- [ ] Simple user experience that works out-of-the-box
- [ ] 5-minute new developer onboarding
- [ ] Convention over configuration approach

## Strategic North Star

### Core Value Proposition
**"Docker Compose for Kubernetes" - The fastest way to run multi-repo microservices with Kubernetes features locally**

### The Problem We Solve
Developers need microservices with Kubernetes features (ingress, service discovery, networking) but existing tools have gaps:
- Docker Compose: ‚ùå Can't emulate nginx ingress controller
- kubectl/helm: ‚ùå Manual coordination, YAML management overhead  
- Skaffold/Tilt: ‚ùå Complex configuration, learning curve

### What We ARE
- ‚úÖ **Fastest path** to multi-service K8s environments
- ‚úÖ **Convention over configuration** for common patterns
- ‚úÖ **Multi-repo friendly** without complex setup  
- ‚úÖ **Kubernetes native** for ingress, networking, service mesh
- ‚úÖ **Development-focused** with hot-reload and debugging

### What We ARE NOT
- ‚ùå New Docker Compose replacement
- ‚ùå Kubernetes abstraction layer
- ‚ùå Highly configurable orchestration platform
- ‚ùå Production deployment tool
- ‚ùå Plugin ecosystem or framework

## User Experience Principles

### 1. Convention Over Configuration
**80/20 Rule**: Optimize for common patterns, provide escape hatches for edge cases

```bash
# This should "just work" with minimal config
devenv init --template microservices
devenv up
# ‚Üí Smart detection of ../api, ../frontend, adds postgres automatically
```

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
**Beginner to Expert Path**: Simple commands expand into powerful options

```bash
# Beginner: Just works
devenv up

# Advanced: Full control when needed
devenv up --only api,postgres --build-logs --wait-for-ready
```

### 3. Immediate Feedback
**Clear status and next steps**: Always show what's happening and what to do next

```bash
$ devenv up
üöÄ Starting development environment...
‚úÖ k3d cluster ready
‚è≥ Building api service... 
‚úÖ PostgreSQL ready
‚úÖ API ready ‚Üí http://api.localhost

Ready for development! üéâ
```

### 4. Smart Defaults, Easy Overrides
**Sensible behavior without configuration**: Works out-of-the-box, customizable when needed

```yaml
# Minimal config that enables maximum functionality
services:
  - name: api
    source: {type: local, path: "../api"}
  - name: postgres  
    source: {type: helm}
```

## Minimal Viable Feature Set

### Phase 1: Essential Commands (80% of use cases)
```bash
devenv init        # Create .devenv/config.yml with sensible defaults
devenv up          # Start everything
devenv logs        # See what's happening  
devenv stop        # Stop everything
devenv status      # Health check
```

### Phase 2: Development Features (20% power user needs)
```bash
devenv up api user # Start subset
devenv restart api # Restart one service after changes  
devenv shell api   # Debug container
devenv forward api # Port forwarding
```

### Phase 3: Multi-Environment (Advanced workflows)
```bash
devenv up --env staging    # Different configurations
devenv switch postgres     # Swap local‚Üîregistry sources
```

## Boundary Decisions - What NOT to Build

### Avoid Feature Creep
- ‚ùå **Custom Kubernetes abstractions** - Use standard k8s resources
- ‚ùå **Complex templating system** - Keep config minimal, use Helm
- ‚ùå **Production deployment features** - Focus on development only
- ‚ùå **Plugin ecosystem initially** - Start with built-in patterns
- ‚ùå **GUI/Web interface** - CLI-first, terminal-friendly
- ‚ùå **Configuration explosion** - Resist Docker Compose complexity

### Stay Focused Test
**"Can a new developer get a multi-service environment with ingress running in under 5 minutes with minimal configuration?"**

If any feature makes this harder, it's outside our scope.

## Architecture Implications

### Opinionated Choices
- **k3d + Helm only** - No additional orchestration layers
- **Convention-based discovery** - Auto-detect common patterns
- **Helm chart templates** - Standard microservice patterns built-in
- **Local registry** - Seamless image building and caching

### Configuration Philosophy
```yaml
# GOOD: Minimal but sufficient
services:
  - name: api
    source: {type: local, path: "../api"}
  - name: postgres
    source: {type: helm}

# BAD: Configuration explosion
services:
  api:
    build:
      context: ../api
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev  
    volumes:
      - ../api:/app
      - /app/node_modules
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
      # ... 20 more lines of config
```

## Implementation Guardrails

### Before Adding Any Feature
Ask these questions:
1. **Does this solve the 5-minute onboarding test?**
2. **Can we achieve this with convention instead of configuration?**
3. **Is this essential for local development with K8s features?**
4. **Does this add cognitive overhead to the basic workflow?**

If any answer is "no", consider alternatives or defer the feature.

### Validation Criteria
- ‚úÖ New developer can run `devenv init && devenv up` successfully
- ‚úÖ Multi-repo services work without complex configuration
- ‚úÖ Kubernetes ingress/networking works out-of-the-box
- ‚úÖ Hot-reload cycle is <10 seconds
- ‚úÖ Configuration file is <20 lines for typical use cases

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- **Time to first success**: <5 minutes from `git clone` to running environment
- **Configuration complexity**: <20 lines of YAML for 80% of use cases
- **Learning curve**: Can use effectively after reading 5-minute quickstart

### Technical
- **Hot-reload speed**: <10 seconds from code change to running service
- **Resource efficiency**: Reasonable CPU/memory usage on development machines
- **Reliability**: Environment starts consistently across different machines

**This north star guides every implementation decision. When in doubt, choose simplicity over configurability, convention over flexibility, and user experience over technical purity.**
